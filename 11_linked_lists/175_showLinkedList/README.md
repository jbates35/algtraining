# Lesson 175
## Showing a Linked List
### Description:
This exercise is designed to provide practice implementing and showing a linked list. A user can enter their elements, and it will create a linked list out of it.
### Setup: 
To use the program, rip the git, and then make a folder build in this folder. I.e.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jbates35/algtraining
$ cd ./algtraining/10_sparse_matrix
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. && make
$ cd 175_showLinkedList 
```
### Example:
There is one optarg for this program, which is:
x - Elements in an array (separated with a space)
```bash
$ ./showLinkedList -x "1 5 2 6 10 3"
```


Another note: If looking through code, the functions of interest are 
```c

```
All of these are found in src/linkedlist.c.
