# Student Challenge 2
## Sparse matrix with linked lists
### Description:
This exercise is meant to see if we can use our linked list library to represent and solve a polynomial.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jbates35/algtraining
$ cd ./algtraining/11_linked_list
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. && make
$ cd 229_polynomial
```
### Example:
Optargs are:
-x value of x
-c coefficients (from highest order to lowest)
```bash
$ ./sparseMatLL -c "1 3 6 0 2" -x 5
```
This will give you a result of:
```
