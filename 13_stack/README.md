# Stack
## Description:
In this chapter, we will explore and program stacks! LIFO! Yay. As I write this I have yet to code anything, but I think stacks both implemented with linked lists and arrays will be explored. 
## Structure
Most of the functionality will be in stack.h. 
## Usage
Much like the last few folders, this will have a root CMakeLists.txt that allows one to simply make a build folder and then make all the subprograms at once. I.e.:

```
git clone https://github.com/jbates35/algtraining
cd ./algtraining/13_stack
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Then to run a program, go:

```
$ cd ./234_stackArray
$ ./stackarr
```
