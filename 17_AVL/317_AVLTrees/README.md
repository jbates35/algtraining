# Lesson 317 - Working with AVL Trees
## AVL Trees, generation, rotation, deletion
### Description:
AVL Trees circumvent the problem BSTs have, which is that BSTs can grow n-elements long in height. AVL alleviates this by rotating it when imbalanced
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/jbates35/algtraining
$ cd ./algtraining/17_AVL
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. && make
$ cd 317_AVLTrees
```
### Example:
-x list of values you want in the BST
```bash
$ ./createBST -x "10 6 5 7 10 13 12 14"
```
```
```
If interested, the functions of note are located in src/bst.c:
