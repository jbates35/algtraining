# Lesson 326 - Working with red-black trees
## Redblack Trees, generation, rotation, deletion
### Description:
Red-black trees use a set of rules to ensure fast insertion and fast retrieval.
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/jbates35/algtraining
$ cd ./algtraining/18_RBTrees
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. && make
$ cd 326_RedBlackTrees
```
### Example:
Just run the command once built.
```bash
$ ./RedBlackTrees
```
Oh man. Can take a look at this code. It works, try running it sure. But it is ugly. So much effort was put into making this that I didn't bother with proving it works. Just use a debugger if you're that keen.
