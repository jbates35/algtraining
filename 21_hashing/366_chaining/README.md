# Lesson 366 - Chaining
## Using chaining to represent a hashmap
### Description:
In this lesson we explore chaining. This will use a linked list at an index decided by the last digit of each key. There are similarities between this and radix sort.
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/jbates35/algtraining
$ cd ./algtraining/21_hashing
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. && make
$ cd build/366_chaining
```
### Example:
Just run the command once built.
```bash
$ ./Chaining
```
This should give you:
```

If interested, the functions of note are located in src/Chaining.c:
