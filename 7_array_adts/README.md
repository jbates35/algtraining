# Array Abstract Data Type (ADT)
## Creating dynamic arrays in C, without linked lists

This section covers ADTs, and shows my practice towards dynamic array types in C. 

In this chapter, I learned about how better to keep track of array sizes, lengths, and functions surrounding arrays that can be implemented with C. Frankly, this section provides a lot of functionality that I really love about C++, even if the code is somewhat messier in C. I can see this <i>really</i> being useful in embedded projects.

I also found out a few things about C indirectly through practicing ADTs. For instance, my knowledge of pointers and undefined behaviour improved, as it was usually most efficient to declare my struct as a pointer to a struct.

Note that the folders of interest will be the "challenge*". I have build instructions if interested, and instructions on how to use the program. I used CMake for all the projects here, and used command line options to be able to have a flexible user input.
