## Exercises while following Abdul Bari's course on Udemy

This is basically where I've been keeping my work for working on my data structures & algorithm skills. My workflow has mostly been:
- Study a couple videos.
- Try to work out the problems on my own
- Verify and test

I've mostly tried to go from the white board exercises to coding them, as I think that's good practice as well. I have typically refrained from trying to look at how someone specifically coded it and copying it unless I'm just *really* stuck. This rarely happened though.

No chatgpt or copilot was used for this either. I'm not at all opposed to them, but that removed some of the struggle that helps me leran, so I wanted to avoid those.

You can enter most folders (I'd say past folder 6 or 7) and you will see a general CMakeLists.txt and instructions on how to build and test the programs yourself.
